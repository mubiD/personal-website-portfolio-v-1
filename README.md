# personal-website-portfolio-v-1

## 17th January, 2022:

This application was built for the purpose of having a platform for showcasing my personal brand. 

## It contains:

An About me section that introduces myself, 
A Projects section - where links to my current deployed applications can be found, 
and a Contact section where users will be able to contact me via the application.

This is a continuous work in progress as this application will serve as my personal up-skilling project.
Features, technologies, libraries and skills that excite me will be practiced and honed using this application.

## Current work in progress:

### Frontend:
    - React
    - React Router
    - React Helmet
    - Bootstrap
    - Custom CSS
    - Proxy 
  
### Backend: 
    - Express 
    - Nodemailer
    -

The resource folder will contain ideas, planning, general notes, etc.
